## 📌 Problem Statement
Efficient scheduling of trains is a complex challenge due to limited track capacity, safety constraints, multiple train types, and dynamic disruptions (delays, breakdowns, weather).  
Our solution integrates *AI + Optimization + Operations Research* to maximize throughput while ensuring safety and real-time adaptability.

## 🔑 Core Components

### 1. *Clustering*
- *What:* Groups similar trains into clusters to simplify optimization.  
- *Why:* Reduces one massive scheduling problem into smaller, conflict-focused sets.  
- *How:* Based on train type (Passenger/Express/Freight), priority, route overlap, and risk scores (from GNN).  

✅ Example:  
- Cluster 1 → Express + Superfast trains on a busy corridor.  
- Cluster 2 → Freight trains sharing a junction.

### 2. *Operations Research (OR)*
Mathematical optimization ensures schedules are safe and efficient.

*a) Linear Programming (LP)*  
- Objective: Minimize delays & congestion, maximize throughput.  
- Variables:  
  - x[t,e] = 1 if train t uses edge e at a certain time.  
- Objective Function:

Z = Σ(delay[t] * priority[t]) + Σ(congestion[e]) + Σ(reroute_cost[t])

*b) Constraint Programming (CP)*  
Handles non-linear railway rules:  
- Safety headway (min time gap between trains)  
- Platform capacity limits  
- Priority rules (Express > Freight)  
- Single track occupancy  
- Valid path constraints  

👉 Together: *LP optimizes, CP guarantees feasibility*.

### 3. *Heuristics & Metaheuristics*
- *Heuristics (Baseline plan):*  
- High-priority trains scheduled first  
- Nearest platform assignment  
- Hold freight trains if congestion is high  
→ Fast, feasible schedule  

- *Metaheuristics (Improvement stage):*  
- Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization  
- Explore solution space beyond heuristics  
- Example: Mutate/swap sequences to reduce congestion  

👉 Pipeline: *Heuristic → Metaheuristic → OR refinement*

### 4. *Reinforcement Learning (RL)*
Dynamic adaptability to real-world disruptions.  
- *State:* Current train positions, schedule, congestion forecast  
- *Actions:* Reroute, resequence, hold, accept OR’s plan  
- *Reward:* Minimize total delay + priority penalties  

✅ Example: RL adjusts schedules when an express train is delayed by 20 mins to reduce ripple effects.

### 5. *Graph Neural Networks (GNN)*
The railway system is a natural *graph*: Stations = nodes, Tracks = edges.  
- *Input:* Train movements over railway graph  
- *Predictions:*  
- Congestion probability on track segments  
- Travel time estimates per train  
- Conflict risk scores  
- *Output embeddings:* Used for smarter clustering & OR/RL guidance  

👉 Example: “Track X congested in 10 mins” → passed to OR & RL for proactive adjustment.

## ✅ End-to-End Flow
1. *Clustering* → Manageable train groups  
2. *Heuristic* → Quick baseline schedule  
3. *Metaheuristic* → Better global solutions  
4. *OR (LP+CP)* → Rigorously optimized, safe schedules  
5. *RL* → Real-time adaptation under disruptions  
6. *GNN* → Predictive intelligence for clustering + optimization

## 🌟 Why This Matters
- *Scalable:* Handles large-scale rail networks  
- *Safe:* Built-in headway & occupancy constraints  
- *Adaptive:* RL enables real-time re-planning  
- *Intelligent:* GNN predicts congestion before it happens  

This hybrid approach combines *optimization, AI, and predictive modeling* for *maximizing section throughput in Indian Railways*.
